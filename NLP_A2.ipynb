This model will tokenize text, create n-grams, and compute their frequencies and probabilities, returning the most frequent n-grams in the text.\n",

However, in the count-based plot, there is a more scattered distribution across the 2 principal components, with some closely semantically related words (e.g., court, jury, election) placed far from others. In the prediction-based plot, the same words appear much more tightly clustered. Given that this plot contains the pre-trained word vectors from a large text corpora, these GloVe embeddings likely captures global word co-occurrence statistics better than the ‘brown_100’ (which only contains the first 100 sentences from the Brown corpus). Furthermore, while GloVe embeddings leverage global co-occurrence matrices, the count-based W2V models local context windows (in the form of bigrams) and therefore may not generalize as well for words that co-occur frequently in different parts of the corpus. This embedding space therefore reflects a stronger semantic relationship between words.\n",

This meaning is reflected in similar words like ‘bend’ or ‘curtsy’, which may be associated with the act of lowering one’s head. A third meaning is nautical, where ‘bow’ denotes the front of a ship.

On the other hand, ‘frosty’ might occur in more niche or less frequent contexts (e.g., ‘frosty morning’ or ‘frosty greeting’) that don't overlap as much with ‘cold’ (or at least not as frequently as ‘hot’), leading to a larger cosine distance despite their synonymous meaning."

    "### Bias in word vectors\n",
    "a. **Observation**: Consider the results of a word vector model when queried with analogies involving \"man\", \"woman\", and \"profession\". What are the top results returned by the model for each query?\n",
    "\n",
    "For the query involving ‘man’ and ‘profession’, the top related words include:\n",
    "‘reputation’, ‘professions’, ‘skill’, ‘skills’, ‘ethic’, ‘business’, ‘respected’, ‘practice’, ‘regarded’, and ‘life’.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the query involving \"woman\" and \"profession\", the top related words include:\n",
    "‘professions’, ‘practitioner’, ‘teaching’, ‘nursing’, ‘vocation’, ‘teacher’, ‘practicing’, ‘educator’, ‘physicians’, and ‘professionals’.\n",
    "\n",
    "b. **Analysis**: Do you observe any gender biases in the results? For example, are certain professions more closely associated with \"man\" or \"woman\" based on the word vectors? Discuss how word embeddings might perpetuate societal biases present in the training data.\n",
    "\n",
    "As based on the output above, I do observe a noticeable gender bias. The word vectors associate ‘woman’ more with caregiving or teaching professions (e.g., nursing, teacher, educator) and \"man\" more with high-status terms (e.g., reputation, skill, ethic, respected). This reflects common societal stereotypes, where women are often linked to roles in education and healthcare, while men are associated with prestige and leadership.\n",
    "\n",
    "This pattern likely stems from biases in the training data, which may overrepresent these associations due to their frequency in news articles, books, or other texts used to train the word vector model. Since word embeddings learn from co-occurrence patterns in language, they tend to replicate and even amplify existing societal biases.\n",
    "\n",
    "c. **Reflection**: How might such biases affect the fairness of machine learning models that use word embeddings? Suggest potential strategies for mitigating gender bias in word vector models.\n",
    "\n",
    "As demonstrated by the gender biases reflected above, biases in word vector models can significantly impact the fairness and reliability of ML systems. For example, biased embeddings may cause automated resume filters to favor male candidates for leadership roles (detecting characteristics associated with ‘skill’ and ‘reputation’), while overlooking equally qualified female candidates. Similarly, in translation services, a language with gender agnostic pronouns may be translated to reflect historically gendered roles (e.g., “he is a CEO” vs. “she is a teacher”). Given that AI is “only as good as its data” [1], curating balanced training data that includes diverse and representative examples of men and women across a wide range of professions could help mitigate bias and word vector models. Another approach involves applying debiasing algorithms, which remove gender-related components from word vectors. For instance, the Limisiewicz et al.’s DAMA algorithm uses causal tracing to identify biased components and applies linear projections to specific layers in a model to effectively reduce gender bias without compromising overall performance [2]. Overall, removing bias in NLP systems is a complex challenge that involves not only identifying and mitigating deeply embedded societal stereotypes in training data, but also balancing fairness with the preservation of model performance.\n",
