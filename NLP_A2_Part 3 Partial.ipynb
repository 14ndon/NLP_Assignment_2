    "## Prediction-Based Word Vectors\n",
    "In this section, we load pre-trained word vectors using the **GloVe** embeddings from the [Stanford NLP paper on GloVe](https://nlp.stanford.edu/pubs/glove.pdf). The pre-trained embeddings provide rich semantic information about words based on large text corpora, allowing us to represent words as vectors that capture their meaning and relationships.\n",
    "\n",
    "Steps:\n",
    "1. **Load GloVe Word Vectors**: We use the GloVe embeddings from the `glove-wiki-gigaword-200` model, which has 200-dimensional vectors for each word.\n",
    "2. **Vocabulary Matching**: We map the words from our corpus to the GloVe vocabulary and extract the corresponding vectors.\n",
    "3. **Dimensionality Reduction**: After obtaining the word vectors, we reduce the dimensionality to visualize the embeddings in 2D space, allowing us to explore word relationships visually.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is an excellent opportunity to explore how pre-trained embeddings like GloVe can be used to improve downstream NLP tasks by providing richer word representations."

    "[Your Answer]\n",
    "\n",
